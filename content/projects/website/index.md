# How this website is built

I decided to build my own SSG almost from scratch because the other ones seemed
to give me too many restrictions on how I can organize my content. It feels like
all the available tools are trying to give you a static version of WordPress
that lets you use markdown for your posts. To be completely honest, I don't like
working with WordPress very much.
