# Yet another blog on the internet

Hello there! I am still trying to come up with a name. This is my personal blog
mostly about computer science and software engineering topics. I have a few
long-term projects I document here as well as a bunch of short articles
explaining some interesting things. I am also experimenting with short sci-fi
stories, but those are written in my native language.

*This website is currently under construction. You can visit [my `custom-ssg`
project](https://github.com/VojtechBrezina/custom-ssg){target=_blank} to see how
it works.*

<div id="keyword-map"></div>
<script type="text/python">
# This could be an svg.
print("TODO: Create one of those fancy graphics from keywords somehow.")
</script>
