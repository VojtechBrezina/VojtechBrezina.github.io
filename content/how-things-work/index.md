# How things work

This is a collection of educational projects about programming. They are further
separated into categories so you can choose what looks interesting to you.
Whenever it makes sense, there are links to repositories with working code. I
try to make those as platform independent as possible but if they deal with
low-level topics or are for some reason written using low-level tooling, they
are written for Linux. This shouldn't be a huge problem as MS Windows has [an
official
subsystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install){target=_blank}
and other operating systems usualy have a POSIX layer and that is what I try to
target as much as possible.

# Maybe do a recursive valk.
