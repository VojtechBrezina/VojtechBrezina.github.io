They are further separated into categories so you can choose what looks interesting to you. Whenever it makes sense, there are links to repositories with working code. I try to make those as platform independent as possible but if they deal with low-level topics or are for some reason written using low-level tooling, they are written for Linux. This shouldn't be a huge problem as MS Windows has <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install target=_blank>an official subsystem</a> and other operating systems usualy have a POSIX layer and that is what I try to target as much as possible.</p> </article></main> </body></html>
