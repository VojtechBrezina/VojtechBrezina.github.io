They say that Linux distributions are just a bunch of configuration files so how hard could this be… My goal is to create a system that builds its software from source where possible and uses something like flatpak for the rest. I would like to gradually build my own version of the following utilities:</p> <ul> <li>A package manager – Preferably not a package repository though. Maybe there is a clever way to steel someone's homework…</li> <li>A Wayland compositor – Or maybe a library, that lets you build your own super fast. I have some ideas about window management that I haven't seen anywhere else.</li> <li>An init system – systemd has some issues. I will first have to carefully examine the alternatives to see if I find something I would like better.</li> <li>Text editor, web browser, terminal multiplexer… – I hate tabs, splits and all that stuff. I am greatly dissatisfied that my system doesn't have a unified keyboard shortcut that would mean "move the focus in this direction". I always have to conciously decide if I am switching tabs in my browser, splits in my code editor or windows on my desktop. Why can everything not be its own window?</li> </ul> <h3 id=creating-a-tool-that-understands-natural-language-without-machine-learning>Creating a tool that understands natural language without machine learning</h3> <p>Today, the term "Artificial Inteligence" is commonly understood to mean machine learning, usually neural networks. I don't like this. They feel unpredictable and their accuracy seems to be limited. The way to address their shortcomings seems to be to just layer them on top of each other and run them in loops. I would like to bring some order to this madness.</p> <p>Natural language is annoying because to understand a sentence, you often have to have additional knowledge. The popular example is something like: "The laptop cannot fit into my backpack, because it is too large." This statement gives us two pieces of information:</p> <ul> <li>A laptop cannot fit into a backpack.</li> <li>The reason for that is that one of them is too large.</li> </ul> <p>To a program trying to parse it without any context, the subject of the second part of this sentence is unknown. To succesfully solve this problem I will have to find an efficient way to store all the information needed to make such distinctions. The <a href=https://www.w3.org/RDF/ target=_blank>Resource Description Framework</a> gave me some ideas about that.</p> </article></main> </body></html>
