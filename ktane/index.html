                    This is a helpful notebook for <span class="yellow">Keep
                    Talking and Nobody Explodes - Road To Centurion</span> made using
                    <a href="https://lotsofs.github.io/KTANE/#RoadToCenturion">this</a>
                    great resource. It is meant to help you exactly the way, you
                    want it to.
                    <p>
                    By default, all it does is provide an overview of the manual
                    that has slots for taking relevant notes. If
                    you think it is fair to do so, you can enable some tools in
                    the Preferences menu. Some of them will just highlight your
                    notes, to make certain pieces of information stand out, others
                    will highlight sections of the rules based on your notes and
                    some of them will even tell you exactly what to do.
                    <p>
                    It is completely up to you and the people you play with where
                    you draw the line.
                    <p>
                    The tools are colorcoded as follows with the highest enabled
                    tool affecting the overall mode displayed at the top:
                    <h3><span class="green">Completely harmless</span></h3>
                    <p>
                    These are things that could realistically be achieved with
                    pen and paper, but they do save some time and effort. They
                    usually just highlight important things in your notes.
                    <h3><span class="yellow">Discutable</span></h3>
                    <p>
                    With these there is still no new information introduced, but
                    they do save a lot of effort. For example by making rules with
                    &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;<i>only if there is a vowel in the
                    serial number</i>&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;
                    have a darker color when that is not the case.
                    <h3><span class="orange">Certainly unfair</span></h3>
                    <p>
                    These tools will even go the extra mile to make the choices
                    for you exactly as the rules describe them and there is
                    probably no excuse for using them in any legitimate game as
                    they will do some basic maths for you and completely break
                    easier modules.
                    <h3><span class="red">Plain cheats</span></h3>
                    <p>
                    These are here just for me to flex my programming skills or
                    perhaps to explore some more complex properties of the modules
                    outside of actual games. These things will do all the
                    computation I can come up with to solve some of the more
                    difficult or even chance based puzzles.
