            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
            I just wanted to create a simple website to hold anything I would like 
            other people to see. It will contain a list of any of my projects I will 
            find interesting and sometimes even demonstrations. In the future, there 
            will probably be a bunch of beginer friendly tutorials on simple games
            or something like that.
            <h2>How?</h2>
            <p>
            Right now, this is a github pages page, so there is no server side.
            I also thought it would be interesting to build something with just
            HTML, JS and CSS, without any libraries. I might add some kind of build 
            step to optimize the files a little, but for now, this is as simple as it
            gets.
