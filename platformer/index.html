            A simple game thrown together in a couple weeks. Made by me and a couple
            friends as we were bored during the covid-19 lockdown.
            <p>
            <a href="platformer.html">Here</a> you can have a fullscreen version if
            you like it more or if your browser is confused.
            <p>
            This game uses an aset pack from

            <h2>A little explanation</h2>
            <p>
            The game can be controlled with WASD or the arrow keys. The only
            objective is to reach the orange worm at the end. In <i>"Chad"</i> mode
            you only get a single checkpoint about half way through, but you can
            choose to avoid that as well. The game <i>*can*</i> be finished even if
            it doesn't seem so.
            <p>
            Be ready for performance issues in the second half as the game is poorly
            optimized.
