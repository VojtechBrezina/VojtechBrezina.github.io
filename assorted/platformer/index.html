            <h1>Platformer</h1>
            <p>A simple game thrown together in a couple weeks. Made by me and a couple friends as we were bored during the covid-19 lockdown.</p>
            <p><a href="platformer.html">Here</a> you can have a fullscreen version.</p>
            <p>This game uses an aset pack from <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-complete-pack-often-updated">opengameart.org</a> by Kenney.nl</p>
            <h2>A little explanation</h2>
            <p>The game can be controlled with WASD or the arrow keys. The only objective is to reach the orange worm at the end. In <i>"Chad"</i> mode you only get a single checkpoint about half way through, but you can choose to avoid that as well. The game <i>*can*</i> be finished even if it doesn't seem so.</p>
            <p>Be ready for performance issues in the second half as the game is poorly optimized.</p>
            <p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/VojtechBrezina/platformer/">here</a>.</p>
